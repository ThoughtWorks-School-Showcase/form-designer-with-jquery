# Form Designer with jQuery
## Business Requirements:
You need to write a form designer, which has these features:
* Add a field
* Select field type
* Remove field
* Preview

### Add a field
There should have an 'Add' button on the page when you click on it, it pops a dialog up for choosing field type. After you chose a field type, the dialog dismissed and a new field with the type you choose added in the form.

### Select field type
In the 'Choose Type' dialog, there are two types of field, they are text and date, you can choose your favorite type and click 'Submit' button to confirm it, or click 'Cancel' to cancel it.

### Remove field
There should have a 'Remove' button on the right of each field when you click it, the field got removed.

### Preview
There should have a 'Preview' button on the page, click it, it changes to 'Edit' so we can toggle modes between editor and previewer. In the previewer mode, you can neither add a new field nor remove a field.

## Practice Challenges:
* Using basic selectors such as id and class name selector
